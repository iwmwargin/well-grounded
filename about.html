        <!-- about Jenny -->
        <h2>About Jenny</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Well-Grounded Massage & Bodywork! My name is Jenny Jolly, and I am delighted to have been practicing massage therapy since 2019. My journey to massage began when I started experiencing chronic muscle pain due to decades of sitting behind a computer working for 40 (and sometimes more) hours a week.</p>

        <p>What began as minor tension headaches and soreness in the neck and shoulders suddenly became chronic, throbbing pain that radiated from the base of my neck up into my teeth, and throughout my face. When my daily yoga practice stopped being a remedy to counteract the bad habits I had developed and the damage I had caused to my body through muscle overuse, neglecting to take body breaks, and poor posture, I became desperate for relief. Doctors prescribed muscle relaxers, heat, and stretching. All of those things helped a little, but the pain just kept coming back.</p>
       
        <p>It wasn’t until I finally started getting regular massages that I started to notice a difference in how I felt. Once I discovered the power of massage, I was hooked! I fell in love with the power and simplicity of this ancient healing modality.</p>
        
        <p>In massage school, I took my journey a step further, learning about how the body moves and how muscles can become dysfunctional and cause problems in the body, especially chronic pain. Now, as a licensed massage therapist, I am eager to share my skills and knowledge with you–to help make a difference in your own quality of life. Whether you’re seeking relaxation or need help managing chronic pain, I am here to serve as a helper and a guide in getting you out of your mind, back into your body, and finding balance again.</p>
        
        <p>Namaste,</p>
        <p>Jenny</p>
